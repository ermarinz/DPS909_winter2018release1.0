# How To Use
This web api runs on port 3000 of your local host meaning that after you launch it you will need to go to http://localhost:3000/ and enter a phone number on the end of the URL

Alternativly you could send a post request tothe same URL wih the form pair of {"phoneNumber":"905 111 2222"}. This should work with any post generater but the one I use is postman https://www.getpostman.com/ 

This api currently only take 1 phonenumber per post and get request.
